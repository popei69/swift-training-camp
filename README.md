Data Structure and Algorithm Challenges in Swift

This is a small workspace to play around and try resolve coding challenges in Swift from different resources.

Disclaimer:

* This is only solutions I worked on, either by myself or based on others solutions I found.
* This isn't a tutorial and doesn't suggest how to resolve a problem. It can only be used as an inspiration, but it's far from being perfect and can include errors or mistakes.
